# 💰 FI Money — Inventory Management API

FI Money is a minimal inventory and product management backend service built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. It includes a simple frontend to interact with the API and perform basic CRUD operations on products. This project is designed as a backend-focused application with clean code structure, RESTful API conventions, and modular components.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- RESTful API for product management
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Simple frontend for testing
- JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication
- Schema auto-initialization via `dbSetup()`
- Modular, maintainable codebase

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

---

## 📦 Install Dependencies

### Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

## 🗄️ Initialize the Database

To automatically create the necessary tables, run:

```bash
cd backend
node dbSetup.js
```

This will execute the `dbSetup()` function inside `utils/dbSetup.js` and set up your PostgreSQL schema.

---

## 🧪 Run the Application

### Start the Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Start the Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The backend runs on `http://localhost:8080/` and the frontend on `http://localhost:5173/` (default Vite port).
